Solver is a console program that simplifies constant numerical expressions. The allowed input characters are '+', '-', '\*', '/', '^', '(', ')', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', and '9'; no white space is allowed, nor are decimal points. Exponentiation by anything the program isn't able to reduce to a rational number is an error, but otherwise, a string of these characters is grammatical if and only if it would be grammatical in a written mathematical expression abiding by the standard rules. Note that towers of exponentiations without parentheses, like '2^2^3', follow the convention of evaluating from bottom to top. Entering a string that begins with the character 'q' exits the program.
